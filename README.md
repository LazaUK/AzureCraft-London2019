This year AzureCraft was held in London on 27th of April at Microsoft Reactor. Was good fun for the parents and kids to sit together and learn how to build Web games using HTML/CSS/JS.

Original code was provided by David Whitney, author of the "Get Coding 2" book (https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Build-Computer-Games-JavaScript/dp/1406382493).

Our version is uploaded to this repo. It includes the following modifications:
- Background music
- Crunching sound when the snake eats the apple
- Score updates in the top left corner.
